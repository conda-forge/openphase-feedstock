  summary: 'OpenPhase is based on the multi-phase-field model as developed by Steinbach and his co-workers'
  description: |
    OpenPhase is an open-source C++ software project started in 2008 at 
    the Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation, 
    Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, Germany. OpenPhase is dedicated to 
    investigating microstructure evolution in materials undergoing 
    first-order phase transformations, capillarity-driven coarsening 
    processes, or a combination of both. Also you may embed the 
    simulation into a macroscopic process simulation which determine 
    boundary conditions on the micro domain, heat fluxed, mechanical 
    loading or others.
